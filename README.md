# NextJs 14 Boilerplate with Prettier and ESLint

This is the NextJs 14 boilerplate that helps me to improve my productivity by enhancing and adding few NPM packages. Simple yet satisfying.

The magic only happens when the development starts.

This package helps to sort the import order, TailwindCSS className, and lint to check unused variable and import.

## How to use
```
npx create-nextjs-ts-boilerplate@latest <package_name>
cd <package_name>
npm run dev
```

- @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin
- @trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports

## Changes

- Clean up the file and restructure the folder structure
- Improve the ESLint configuration
- Add Prettier configuration
  - Add sort order and plugin
